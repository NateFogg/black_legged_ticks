# The Data 
Tick surveillance data reported to the CDC ArboNET (Tick Module): Data release guidelines

a. Access to ArboNET Tick Module data is limited to the “Requestor” who downloads these data. These data should not be provided to other persons. All other requests for access to ArboNET Tick Module data should be directed to the tick surveillance website where the requestor can agree to data usage terms and to download the data (https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/surveillance/TickSurveillanceData.html)

b. The ArboNET Tick Module will be appropriately referenced in any publications or presentations derived from these data. A final copy of the publications or presentations resulting from these data will be provided to the CDC Division of Vector-Borne Diseases (ticksurveillance@cdc.gov).

Limitations of ArboNET Tick Module data

1. ArboNET is a passive surveillance system that relies on jurisdictions to voluntarily collect and report non-human, vector-borne infection and ecologic data.

2. Vector-borne disease awareness, pathogen testing capacity, and reporting varies substantially by county, state, region, and from year-to-year. Therefore, ArboNET Tick Module data may not be representative of true differences in tick presence and abundance or pathogen presence and prevalence in ticks by jurisdiction, or over time.

CDC tick population classifications:

Established - Six or more ticks of a single life stage, or more than one life stage collected in the county within a 12-month period.

Reported - Less than six ticks of a single life stage collected in the county within a 12-month period.

No records - Counties classified as "no records" should not be interpreted as ticks being absent. No records classification could arise from a lack of either sampling efforts or tick collection, or from a lack of reporting or publishing the results of sampling efforts.

CDC tick pathogen classifications:

Present - counties where indicated tickborne pathogens have been identified in one or more host-seeking blacklegged ticks, using pathogen species-specific molecular methods.

No records - Counties classified as "no records" should not be interpreted as ticks being absent. No records classification could arise from a lack of either sampling efforts or tick collection, or from a lack of reporting or publishing the results of sampling efforts.
